The "Modern Business Website" is a responsive web application designed to showcase services, collect client testimonials, and facilitate contact with potential customers. Built using Tailwind CSS for styling and Font Awesome for icons, this project provides a clean and modern interface for any business's online presence.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd modern-business-website
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file:
   - You can simply double-click on `index.html` or open it from your browser.

No additional installation is required, as the project utilizes CDN for styles and fonts.

## Usage

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following external libraries:

- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons used within the navigation and service sections.

These libraries are included via CDN in the `index.html`, so no additional installation is necessary.

## Project Structure

```
/
|-- index.html               # Main HTML file
```

- **index.html**: Contains the complete HTML structure, styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. It includes sections like navigation, hero, services, testimonials, contact form, and footer.

This structure keeps everything contained within a single HTML file for simplicity and ease of use.
